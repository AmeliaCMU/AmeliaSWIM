## Overview

**AmeliaSWIM**: This tool that contains the raw dataset download scripts as well as scripts to preprocess and filter the data. It also contains the fences used on QGIST to delimit the ROI of the airports.

[Amelia-42](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) dataset contains the trajectory as well map data. More information is available on the dataset [website](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) and a subset of this prosseed data can be found in HuggingFace [Amelia42-Mini](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmeliaCMU/Amelia42-Mini) and our Benchmark dataset in [Amelia10](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmeliaCMU/Amelia-10).

## Pre-requisites

### Installation

Make sure that you have [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed.

**Recommended:** Use the  [`install.sh`](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/blob/main/install.sh) to download and install the Amelia Framework:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh amelia
```

This will create a conda environment named `amelia` and install all dependencies.

Alternatively, refer to [`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/AmeliaCMU/AmeliaScenes/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for manual installation.

**Note:** AmeliaSWIM only requires the itself to run, only refer to AmeliaSWIM installation.

## Download Processed Data for 10 airports

To download the processed data for 10 airports used for the Amelia Benchmark [list](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) can be found at [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmeliaCMU/Amelia-10), this will contain the processed csv files and the map assets and contains the following airports one month of the following airports:

- Boston-Logan Intl. Airport - Jan 2023
- Newark Liberty Intl. Airport - Mar 2023
- Ronald Reagan Washington Natl. Airport - April 2023
- John F. Kennedy Intl. Airport - April 2023
- Los Angeles Intl. Airport - May 2023
- Chicago-Midway Intl. Airport - June 2023
- Louis Armstrong New Orleans Intl. Airport - July 2023
- Seattle-Tacoma Intl. Airport - Aug 2023
- San Francisco Intl. Airport - Sept 2023
- Ted Stevens Anchorage Intl. Airport - Nov 2023

### Download and Process Raw Data for any of the 42 airports

To download and convert trajectory data for any of the 42 airports in the [Amelia Dataset](https://ameliacmu.github.io/amelia-dataset/) for any time after Dec 1 2022, use the following steps


### Download raw files

The raw SWIM SMES `.njson.gz` files can be downloaded using the following script:

```bash
python download_raw.py --endpoint <minio-endpoint> \
                       --bucket <bucket-name> \
                       --start_time <start-time> \
                       --end_time <end-time> \
                       --destination <destination>
```

Where:

- `<minio-endpoint>`: MinIO server endpoint. By default, this is set to `airlab-share-01.andrew.cmu.edu:9000`.
- `<bucket-name>`: Name of the bucket to download files from. By default, this is set to `ameliaswim`.
- `<start-time>`: The start time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. By default it is set to `2023-01-01 00:00:00`.
- `<end_time>`: The end time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. By default it is set to `2023-01-02 00:00:00`.
- `<destination>`: Local directory to save the downloaded files. By default it is set to `swim_data/`.

This will download the raw files from the MinIO server and save them in the specified destination directory.


### Process Data (convert files from njson to csv)

```bash
python process.py data=<insert_month> airports=<airport_ICAO>
```

Where:

- `<insert_month>`: Specifies the month for which you want to process the data. You may set any of the yaml files in the path `conf/data/*/*.yaml` for example `apr` or set your own. This will determine the time frame that to witch process the data.
In the `conf/data` folder there is also a `base.yaml` file wher it is possible to set the following options:
  - `datapath`: where the raw files should be downloaded or searched (if `download` is set to `True`)
  - `out_path`: output director of the processed files in csv format
  - `window`: Time (in sec) Duration for each CSV
  - `n_jobs`: Num CPUs to use
  - `parallel`: Use parallel processing
  - `download`: Download the Raw Data (set to false if you already have the raw data in the `datapath` directory)
  - `overwrite`: Overwrite the processed data if it is found

- `<airport_ICAO>`: The ICAO code of the airport for which you want to process the data. The available airports are set in the `conf/airports` folder. You can set any of the yaml files in the path `conf/airports/*/*.yaml` for example `klax`.

#### Other Options

In `conf/data/base` the following options exist:

- `datapath`: Base Path for Raw Data
- `outpath`: Base Path for Processed Data
- `window`: Time (in sec) Duration for each CSV
- `n_jobs`: Num CPUs to use
- `parallel`: Use parallel processing
- `download`: Download the Raw Data (set to false if you already have the raw data)
- `overwrite`: Overwrite the processed data if it is found
- `start_time`: utc linux start time
- `end_datetime`: utc linux end time

In `conf/airports/<airport ICAO>` the following options exist:

- `airport`: Name of the airport
- `ref_lat`: Ref latitude to calculate  x,y cartesian
- `ref_lon`: Ref longitude to calculate  x,y cartesian
- `max_alt`: Max agent altitude to filter
- `fence`: Geo-fence to filter data

#### Example

If you would like to process the data for KLAX for Mar 2023 overwriting the existing and not downloading data a you can run the following command:

```bash
python python process.py data=mar airports=klax data.overwrite=True data.download=False
```

## Modify / Create Polygons in QGIST

In order to modify or create new polygons, we used the [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) software.

  <h5>QGIS Software Logo.</h5>
</div>

### Loading CSV file and creating polygons

1. Open QGIS
2. Click on `Layer` -> `Add Layer` -> `Add Delimited Text Layer`
3. Select the Layer
4. In Processing Toolbox search for Points to Path
5. In Processing Toolbox search for Lines to Polygons

<div align="center">
  <img width="500" src="./assets/QGIS_add_layer.png" alt="QGIST">
  <h5>QGIS Add Layer</h5>
</div>

### Modify Polygons

1. Select the layer
2. Click on `Toggle Editing` (yellow pencil)
3. Click on the `Split Parts` or `Split Features` tool
4. Create lines to split the polygon using right click and left click

<div align="center">
  <img width="500" src="./assets/QGIS_tools.png" alt="QGIST">
  <h5>QGIS Tools</h5>
</div>

### Export Polygon's coordinates

1. Right click on the layer
2. Click on `Open Attribute Table`
3. Select the Polygon you want to export (it will be highlighted in yellow)
4. Click on copy

<div align="center">
  <img width="200" src="./assets/QGIS_attribute_table.png" alt="QGIST">
  <img width="500" src="./assets/QGIS_features_tool.png" alt="QGIST">
  <h5>QGIS Coordinates</h5>
</div>

Once copied it can be pasted in a notepad to create a csv file
